# ForgeMarketing

ForgeMarketing is a human-in-the-loop marketing operations tool for small teams.

It helps teams plan campaigns, draft content, organize assets, track manual tasks, and record performance across platforms without risky automation.

## What ForgeMarketing Does

- Organizes work by brand/product and campaign.
- Tracks content from idea to draft, review, approval, scheduling, and posted state.
- Represents manual platform setup and posting steps as checklist tasks.
- Supports optional AI drafting assistance, always requiring human review.
- Tracks posted URLs and follow-up performance checks.

## What ForgeMarketing Does Not Automate

- Social account creation.
- Platform verification.
- Mass following, auto-commenting, or DM spam.
- Any workflow that bypasses platform terms.
- Auto-publishing unapproved AI output.

## Human Approval Philosophy

ForgeMarketing helps teams plan and manage marketing content. It does not automatically create accounts, bypass platform rules, or post content without human approval. Account creation, platform verification, and final publishing should be completed by authorized humans following each platform's terms and policies.
